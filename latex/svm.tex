\subsection{Classification through Machine Learning}
We extended Matlab's built in SVM (Support Vector Machine) for use with multi class problems. An individual classifier was trained for each symbol. Each of these SVMs was run on a symbol and their corresponding confidence rating was recorded. We then simply used the classification that was given with the highest confidence. Each of our SVMs used a radial basis kernel function (Equation \ref{RBF}). 
\eq{K(x, x') = \exp(-\frac{||x-x'||^2}{2\sigma{}^2})}{RBF}
