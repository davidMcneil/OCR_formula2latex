\section{Process}
\textit{Document clearly describes the overall process followed, including all preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and post-processing. All details are included, so that your study could be replicated. Includes images
}

Our methodology can be broken into three steps: image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification using machine learning. At each step, we attempt to further summarize the information found in an image. Our end goal is to summarize the image of a mathematical expression down to a string representation of that same expression.
