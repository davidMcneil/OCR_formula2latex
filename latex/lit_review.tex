Optical character recognition (OCR) has been the subject of much research through the past and provides a direct application of machine learning. We were able to harness the work done in the past in order to enhance the work done in our project. 

Eikvil's work \cite{one} not only provided numerous methods of feature extraction but also summarized the robustness and practicality of each algorithm. Using sensitivity to noise, distortions, style, translation, and rotation to quantify robustness and speed, complexity, and independence to measure practicality. The paper strongly recommended using zoning and moments as features. Both of which we used in our project.

Hansen's work \cite{two} specifically outlined implementing OCR in Matlab which provided a general model for our implementation.
